    ~~~~~~~~

    Dotfiles is a tool to make managing your dotfile symlinks in $HOME easy,
    allowing you to keep all your dotfiles in a single directory.  Hosting is
    up to you. You can use a VCS like git, Dropbox, or even rsync to distribute
    your dotfiles repository across multiple hosts.
